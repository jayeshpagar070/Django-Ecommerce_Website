This project showcases a dynamic website built using Django, featuring a modern and responsive design. The website leverages various technologies to provide a robust and scalable web application. Below is an overview of the technologies used:

Django: A powerful Python web framework used to build the core of the website. Django’s MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture ensures a clean and maintainable codebase, with built-in support for user authentication, URL routing, and database management.

Django API: Implemented for creating RESTful APIs that enable seamless communication between the front-end and back-end. The API endpoints handle data retrieval, updates, and interaction with the database.

HTML: The foundational language for creating the structure of the web pages. HTML is used to define the content and layout of each page, ensuring a clear and organized presentation of information.

CSS: Utilized for styling the website and enhancing its visual appeal. Custom CSS is used to ensure that the website looks great across different devices and screen sizes.

Bootstrap: A popular front-end framework used for designing responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. Bootstrap provides pre-designed components and a flexible grid system, which speeds up development and ensures a consistent look and feel.

SQLite: The database used for storing and managing data. SQLite is a lightweight and self-contained database engine that is well-suited for development and small to medium-sized applications.

This dynamic website integrates these technologies to deliver a user-friendly and interactive experience. The combination of Django’s back-end capabilities with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SQLite results in a powerful and elegant web application.
